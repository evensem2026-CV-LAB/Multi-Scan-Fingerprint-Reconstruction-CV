Traditional single-image enhancement techniques may fail to recover sufficient ridge detail for reliable matching.</p>"},{"location":"#key-idea","title":"Key Idea","text":"<p>This project implements a classical computer-vision pipeline that utilizes multi-capture fusion. Instead of relying on a single scan, we acquire 3\u20135 scans of the same finger, align them, and fuse them to reconstruct a high-quality fingerprint. This approach is: - Lightweight: Optimized for low-power devices. - Non-Deep Learning: Uses classical image processing techniques for explainability and speed. - Cost-Effective: Designed for deployment in low-cost biometric centers like e-Mitra.</p>"},{"location":"#pipeline-overview","title":"Pipeline Overview","text":"<p>The reconstruction process follows these steps: 1.  Multi-Capture Acquisition: Capture 3-5 images of the same finger. 2.  Preprocessing: Apply histogram equalization and noise filtering. 3.  Registration: Align images using ridge orientation-based registration. 4.  Fusion: Combine aligned images using confidence-weighted fusion. 5.  Enhancement: Apply DWT-based enhancement and restoration. 6.  Output: Generate a final reconstructed fingerprint with improved ridge clarity.</p>"},{"location":"#team","title":"Team","text":"<p>We are a team of students working on this computer vision project.</p> <ul> <li>Chirag Taneja</li> <li>Ansh</li> <li>Lakshit</li> <li>Siddhi</li> </ul>"},{"location":"methodology/","title":"Methodology","text":"<p>This section details the classical computer vision pipeline used to reconstruct high-quality fingerprints from multiple low-quality scans.</p>"},{"location":"methodology/#1-multi-capture-acquisition","title":"1.

Registration (Alignment)","text":"<p>Since the user may place their finger slightly differently for each scan, the images must be perfectly aligned. We use a ridge orientation-based registration method: - Feature Extraction: Detect minutiae points and ridge orientation fields. - Transformation: Calculate the optimal rotation and translation parameters to align all secondary images to the primary (reference) image.</p>"},{"location":"methodology/#4-confidence-weighted-fusion","title":"4. Confidence-Weighted Fusion","text":"<p>Once aligned, the images are fused. Instead of simple averaging, we use a confidence-weighted approach: - Areas with higher clarity and distinct ridge patterns are given higher weights. - Noisy or blurred regions contribute less to the final image. This ensures that the best parts of each scan are preserved.</p>"},{"location":"methodology/#5-dwt-based-enhancement","title":"5.
